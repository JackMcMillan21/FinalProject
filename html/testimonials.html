                    <span>I contacted MWIS in hopes of them being able to prove some of the ratial disrimination that
                        was
                        going on towards
                        me at work, and to my surprise they not only proved that helping me get justice, but also proved
                        it
                        for all of the
                        other employees of color, bringing everyone justice!</span>

                    <span>Earlier this year I had a suspicion of my partner on the job spending a bit too much time in
                        the
                        evidence locker.
                        After some very small digging I found out that a large amount of the people in my station have
                        been
                        destroying/stealing evidece.
                        Thanks to MWIS all of those dirty cops are in jail!

                    <span>During my last 2 years at a high end insurance firm I have noticed that some of my supperiors
                        have
                        been getting pretty "lucky" breaks
                        on the market lately. I had a suspicion that something bad was going on, and with the help of
                        MWIS a
                        majority of them were all laid off
                        after being charged with insider trading.

                    <span>I worked with MWIS just over a year ago now, and I am extremely grateful for what they have
                        done
                        for me. Working in a male dominated
                        job I notice alot of comments and actions made towards me that I was never comfortable with, and
                        after one that completly crossed the
                        line I gave MWIS a call and they brought disiplinary action onto those employess as necessary.

                    <span>Just over 2 years ago now I joined a digital forensics team that focusus on catching people
                        that
                        are in possession or distribution
                        of ilicid videos towards people that are under the age of 18. Soon after coming on this
                        taskforce I
                        noticed that evidence was not
                        being handled at all and these childrens privacy was being absolutely violated. Thanks to MWIS
                        these
                        terrible people finnaly got what was
                        coming to them </span>
